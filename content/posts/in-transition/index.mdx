<div class="poem">
<ul>
<li>Seeds of change, dispersed across London.</li>
<li>Across the UK, and around the world.</li>
<li>In a breeze of hope and possibility.</li>
<li>Sprouting, growing, blossoming and emerging.</li>
<li>Nurtured with loving care.</li>
<li>Stewarded by passionate, determined people.</li>
<li>Bringing life to forgotten, overlooked spaces.</li>
<li>Each an oasis of calm.</li>
<li>A unique expression of the people it serves.</li>
<li>Providing the rich soil within which community can strengthen its roots.</li>
<li>Deepening and expanding the web of relationships that sustains it.</li>
<li>Whilst navigating the constant ebb and flow of transition.</li>
<li>As we chart a course towards our imagined futures.</li>
<li>Inviting and inspiring others to join us.</li>
</ul>
