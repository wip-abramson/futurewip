> A poem written after visiting the awe inspiring Machu Pichu about the monuments we leave to the future.

<br/>

<div class="poem">
<ul>
<li>A glimpse into the past.</li>
<li>Through a jewel on the mountainside.</li>
<li>Whose purpose and function we can only speculate.</li>
<li>Cloaked in ethereal clouds and the passage of time.</li>
<li>Crafted with intention and a careful attention to detail.</li>
<li>By a civilization, a culture and a people we can never truly know.</li>
<li>Who were these people?</li>
<li>What drove them to build such wonders?</li>
<li>There is sadness mixed into awe.</li>
<li>The loss of the Inka,</li>
<li>Erased.</li>
<li>Ways of knowing and being in this world.</li>
<li>Leaving only scattered remnants,</li>
<li>In an ever more patched memory.</li>
<li>All this leaves me wondering,</li>
<li>What impressions will we leave on the world.</li>
<li>For future generations,</li>
<li>For future civilizations.</li>
<li>To speculate over.</li>
<li>Then I recall,</li>
<li>Our impressions will not be monuments,</li>
<li>But deep scars in the ecological record.</li>
<li>That will scream out into the future.</li>
<li>For eons.</li>
<li>How will we be remembered?</li>
<li>What stories will they tell about us?</li>
<li>Five hundred years from now.</li>
<li>One thousand.</li>
<li>What heritage will we leave for the future,</li>
<li>Other than destruction.</li>
</ul>
