> These words were written after reading a [news article and watching the accompanying video](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/17/armed-police-threatened-to-arrest-kent-protester-for-holding-palestinian-flag) of armed police challenging a peaceful single protestor holding a Palestinian flag in Kent. These words were written by a British citizen and a compasionate, caring human who feels for the plight of the Palestinian people whilst also trying to empathise for Israeli's caught up in this shameful period of human history.

> To be absolutely crystal clear, I do not, have not, and will not ever support Palestine Action. These words should not be interpreted in any way to mean support for this proscribed group. However, I do deeply and strongly support the plight of the Palestinian people in these dark and testing times.

Do watch the video and make your own mind up before reading my reaction.

Reflecting on the recent proscription of the Palestine Action group and its implications on this country I call home.

A terrifying slide towards authoritarianism continues apace.

I recently became acquainted with the term proscription through an excellent series of historical fiction, [Masters of Rome](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43716-masters-of-rome), by [Colleen McCullough](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/30/colleen-mccullough). Shout out to Brooky for the recommendation. This series traces the life of Caesar from before his birth until after his death, over a tumultuous period of Ancient Roman history that saw the republic disintegrate into an autocracy. Throughout this period, [proscriptions and proscribing was used regularly as a tool of the political elite](https://www.britannica.com/topic/proscription), those on top of a power struggle, to target enemies and crush dissent. 
To be honest, I thought proscription was an antiquated relic of the past. So you can imagine my shock to hear that the Labour Government was considering, and then legislated for the [proscription of Palestine Action](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/three-groups-to-be-proscribed).

Yes, [breaking in to secure UK military compounds and vandalising security infrastructure](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn81g4e0nlyo) is a serious offence and should be taken seriously. But, so is supplying and supporting a nation state on a bombing campaign that is killing an unimaginable number of innocent lives. Innocent children. 17000 children to date is the number recognized in July 2025 I believe. The United Nations has labelled this a genocide, yet our government refuses to acknowledge it. Refuses to listen. The people, the caring, compassionate citizens of this beautiful country, are fed up. They are not being heard. They are, understandably I think it is fair to say, exploring other avenues to get their voices heard. 

Also, as a side note, isn't it a serious concern for the UK and its secure facilities that a bunch of protesters can infiltrate and vandalise such a facility. That seems like a serious failing in UK security protocols that should be investigated.

Anyway, back to the proscription. The answer, I would have thought, is not to proscribe an organisation like Palestine Action, and do it so broadly, that simply holding a Palestinian Flag, making a statement about freeing Gaza and pointing out a statement of fact as espoused by the United Nations of whom we are a part is responded to by armed police. Armed police who threaten arrest and claim that all these actions can, and will be, interpreted as support for a proscribed organisation as per the legislation. A name and address is taken, with follow up consequences alluded to. 

Sorry, but are we living in the Britain I know and love, or did I miss the point where we tipped over into authoritarianism. This is a disgrace. And a shocking abuse of power. We will not stand for it. This is bloody Britain! Don't you dare try illegitimately erode our rights for legitimate protest.

That this has happened under a Labour Government as well, is just beyond the pail. 

Keir, mate, when I voted for you I knew you were a wetty, but I thought you at least had principles. A moral compass. All your experience human rights and international law pointed to this. You must know this will follow you around forever. You must know this is wrong.

SHAME ON YOU LABOUR. SHAME ON YOUR KEIR STARMER. 

I am disgusted. Words fail me.
