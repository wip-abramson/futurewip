<br/>

<div class="poem">
<ul>
<li>So many moment of history</li>
<li>Localised within space and time</li>
<li>Unfolding and experienced</li>
<li>Uniquely</li>
<li>By those present</li>
<li>Percieved through our own lens' of meaning</li>
<li>These experiences</li>
<li>The stories we tell about them</li>
<li>And the meanings we make from them</li>
<li>Ripple and reverberate</li>
<li>Out into the future</li>
<li>Shaping us</li>
</ul>
