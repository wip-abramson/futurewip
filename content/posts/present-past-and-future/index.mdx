<div class="poem">
<ul>
<li>Our past, past.</li>
<li>Our future, unknown.</li>
<li>The present, now.</li>
<li>All we can ever experience.</li>
<li>And yet.</li>
<li>The present encodes our past,</li>
<li>And anticipates our futures.</li>
<li>Memories and meanings.</li>
<li>Hopes and possibilities.</li>
<li>All are rendered,</li>
<li>In our structured experience.</li>
</ul>
