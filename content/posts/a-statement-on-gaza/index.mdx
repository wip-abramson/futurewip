> Raw reflections triggered by the Kneecap set - for which I had a front row seat for every minute of that madness and mahem - the Bob Vylan debacle for which I was not present and the ensuing aftermath. Both in the mainstream media and in my mind, and the minds of memory fellow festival goers and the stumbled beaming with joy around Glastonbury Festival.

We are not idiots. We can all see, feel, touch taste and smell this shared realm we inhabit.

I was at Kneecap. The whole thing. In the mix. Deep in the pits.

Let me tell you how I saw it from my perspective.

I am going to reflect honestly, off the cuff and from a place of deep shame and utter disgust to be quite frank.

But before I dive into all that. Before you have made your decision about me and my thoughts. 

Before you have placed me in a box, that doesn't fit.

With all your neat, convenient prepackaged labels. Fuck that.

If you do one thing, before you react to my words. Ideally, before you even read them. Then spend an hour of your life watching the Kneecap set in full, raw, unedited footage. 

Then, tell me how you really feel.

You can find it here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fbpw/glastonbury-kneecap

Look deep within, sense into your self, your soul. Try to empathise with the people of Palestine. Try to comprehend, even just for a moment, just for a glimpse, the sheer unimaginable hell on earth that they are living through. Going through. Day after day. Moment after moment.

Women. Kids. Babies.

It's hard. I get it. These two excellent podcast episodes from This American Life do a wonderful job of adding texture, depth and humanity to these lives, [ [1](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/834/transcript ), [2](https://open.spotify.com/episode/73yLS4jXFKRaTqaG8nXBQH?context=spotify%3Aplaylist%3A37i9dQZF1FgnTBfUlzkeKt&nd=1&dlsi=62a682804ddc4c36) ]. You should listen to them.

Whatever we think about this issue. Whatever side of the isle we sit.  

At the end of the day, when it all comes down to it. These are our fellow human beings. They are mothers, lovers, children, families and more. 

All the rich, messy complexity that makes each and every one of us unique in our own special way.

What have these lovely, loved and loving humans ever done to deserve this.

How is it justifiable?

Who is accountable? Who will hold them to account.

Because let me tell you right now, I am fed up. What are we to do?

Fuck Keir Starmer. 

Seriously mate, you are a joke. How do you look yourself in the mirror each day? What do you stand for?

It is despicable behaviour from someone who should know better. No. Who does know better.

If you are ever reading this Keir, seriously fuck you. Listen to the crowd chant that. With feeling. With meaning.

You have failed us.

You don't represent us.

We need change. The world is burning. And you just sit there twiddling with your todger. [Trying to squeeze some spare change out of the disabled](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/27/welfare-bill-cuts-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news-updates).

Right, I have some more reflections. These were captured as I thought back about the Kneecap set for the remainder of the magical weekend at Worthy Farm.

Brought to you fresh, raw and pretty much unedited.

A straight up, stream of consciousness. 

Enjoy! 

Or don't, depends how you see it I imagine.

Right, let me let you have it. 

Dropping some truth bombs, like Mo Chara and Móglaí Bap.

Give it up for 💕. If there is one thing and one thing only that you take away from Glastonbury, or any festival, any mutually shared experience even. It is that love trumps hate. 

ALL. DAY. LONG.

It's more fun. More joyful. More infectious. 

So fuck Keir Starmer and all those politicians spreading hate.

A wise man once told me. Rise above it.

We will shower them in love x

On that note... 

Who fecking saw kneecap

That shit was carnage

Those boys know the score

Big love to Mo Chara and the Kneecap crew

[At a minimum, watch the first 5 minutes of the kneecap set](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fbpw/glastonbury-kneecap). They had a wonderful intro. 

Fuck Keir Starmer

This drivel from the Israeli embassy, then presented verbatim and unchallenged by the mainstream media is so disappointing.

> Chants such as ‘Death to the IDF’ and ‘From the river to the sea’ are slogans that advocate for the dismantling of the state of Israel and implicitly call for the elimination of Jewish self-determination. When such messages are delivered before tens of thousands of festivalgoers and met with applause, it raises serious concerns about the normalisation of extremist language and the glorification of violence.”

I whole heatedly and firmly reject this framing of reality. It is limited, single minded and lacking imagination and the ability to see through the myriad of perspectives that shape our world. Open your eyes and look around you.

To the BBC I say this. What are you hiding. Why have you repeatedly worked to silence and stiffle the voices and experiences of those living through and experiencing this genocide. This bombing. This starvation. This heartbreak and sorrow. How is that being impartial.

Why are you preventing and obstructing multiple media productions about the lived experiences of Palestinian's living under Israeli oppression. 

Go see some alternative media offerings. Like [No Other Land](https://dochouse.org/event/no-other-land/), that can be found at delightful establishments such as the Bertha DocHouse in London. 

At least the Beeb showed Louis Theroux's recent production. How could they not, he is a national treasure. And a brave, brave man who has my upmost respect. The footage is horrifyingly shocking. It can be found here - https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002bm1y.

Go what all that.

Then tell me who is really raising "serious concerns about the normalisation of extremist language and the glorification of violence." It's a joke.

Or, how about watching the [Bibi files](https://dochouse.org/event/the-bibi-files/). Another one that can be found shown in the DocHouse.

Tell me how is this not just a horrifying and accelerating slide towards authoritarianism that we are hurtling towards.

Tell me how we, the Brits, are not at least partly complicit in this. How Keir Starmer is not implicated.

Us Brits, as many of you who will know one, are bloody good people. We deserve better from our leaders. The whole world does practically.

> "We understand colonialism and we understand how important it is to support each other internationally," 

Wise words from Mr Mo Chara himself.

And that gets me back round to my point. My reason for writing this statement in the first place.

It revolves Bob Vylan, a chant and the unfolding aftermath that is taking place.

Because I actually totally agree with the sentiment expressed by the mainstream media. There is just one, small, almost innocous, slight of hand going on that they won't speak to. Maybe you noticed it.

Let me be absolutely clear.

I WOULD NEVER, EVER, EVER, CONDONE THE CHANTING THAT CALLS FOR THE DEATH OF FELLOW HUMANS. 

Humans living, loving, laughing and crying. Sharing this beautiful planet with me.

No way. No one wants that.

I wouldn't chant death to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. I wouldn't condone such chanting, although I suspect many of the mainstream media stirring the pot wouldn't blink twice if such chanting did occur.

Those poor Russian fellows are caught up in the power games and authoritarianism of their part of the world. You feel for them. How can you not.

HOWEVER. 

And this bit is crucial.

I WOULD CHANT DEATH TO WAGNER GROUP.

I WOULD CHANT DEATH TO THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITARIAN WAR MACHINE.

So would you, no? So should you!

That is the thing here. Kneecap, Bob Vylan, even me in my own way and words.

We are just dropping truth bombs. The only thing the can kill is ideas and the egos of old men who greedily cling on to power as the uprising and resistance defiantly tries to shake them free.

Now, to be clear. I was not in the Bob Vylan set. BUT. From the media coverage it seems no one said, as far as I can tell, death to Israeli soldiers. I feel for them too. Trapped and caught up in the long, ugly shadow of the past. The abused becoming the abuser played out at the scale of a society. 

I will say this, firmly. Loudly. Defiantly. Without a shadow of a doubt.

HISTORY WILL JUDGE YOU. SHAME ON YOU.

Tell me who are the ones really spreading hate. Manipulating reality with lies and omissions. Pandering to the rich and powerful. It is a disgrace. It is dispicable. 

How can you gamble with out future. With our childrens future.

Let's be honest to ourselves. Listen to what we know is true. This "war" on Gaza, on Palestine and its people, is unjustifiable. If cannot and should not continue. 

So yeah. Death to the Israeli Defence Force as an organisation that is capable of committing war crimes. That is capable, and blatantly, irrefutably continues to snipe children. Even babies in the head. Don't take it from me, take it from the doctors who treated them - https://www.thisamericanlife.org/859/transcript. Shocking, sickening and horrifying.

So yeah, I will say it loud and proud.

DEATH TO THE ISRAELI DEFENCE FORCE. DEATH TO THE ISRAELI WAR MACHINE.

Death to all entities, all ideologies, hell even all countries the revolve and sustain themselves through spreading hate and monopolizing violence.

Fuck them.

Can we not agree on that?

One final note, before we move on from Kneecap. I have so much respect for the Kneecap boys for taking a stand. I have so much respect for Emily and Glastonbury for staying strong against the political pressure. I also have so much respect for Bob Vylan for taking some of the pressure of them. Think about it they are just wee Irish boys from Belfast. Catapulted to the forefront of a movement. The pressure they must have been under. Can't even imagine.

Time for us all to speak truth to power in whatever way we can, use our voice and our presence to weave a more loving, friendly reality for ourselves and our friends. 

Those who want to join us, exploring alternative, positive, possible futures for our selves on this beautiful planet we call home.

So yeah free Mo Chara, free free Mo Chara. I'll try be at there court case on the 20th of August. Let me know if you want to join.

Shower them in it. Smother them in it.

Hard to survive a love bombing untouched and unmoved.
