> This is a passionate, heartfelt plea to my local MP, Catherine West, over the unconscionable situation unfolding in Gaza and the disappointing lack of meaningful action from this Labour Government. The only action I have seen taken with conviction has lead to this country teetering terrifyingly on the precipice of authoritarianism, where harmless ladies are threatened with arrest by armed police for simply voicing their views. To those spearheading this effort, I say strongly you will not succeed in our beautiful country. We will not stand for it.


Hi Catherine,

I am writing to you as a Labour voter, from a family of Labour voters. I am writing to you as a voter who is struggling to see how I can ever vote Labour again. I feel let down and ignored, as it seems much of the country does.

I hope you will take what I have to say in this email gravely seriously. I cannot be the only one who thinks voting for Keir's Labour Government is untenable.

My disappointment and disgust stem from two interconnected issues.

First, the severe inaction of the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The unfolding genocide as the United Nations described it on the 31st of October 2024. 9 months ago! Things have gotten much worse.

> **'It Is Important to Call a Genocide a Genocide,â€™** [^1]

Today I read a harrowing article in The Guardian depicting the poor people of Gaza's desperate struggle to get life-sustaining humanitarian aid from the so-called "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation". These journeys of survival have turned into terrifying lotteries in which people - human beings - must run the gauntlet of Israeli controlled and patrolled militarised areas and check points. Often at night. Then they must madly scramble to get supplies for the brief windows these places are open [^2]. This article was hard to read.

People are dying (more than 1000 people since May according to UNRWA [^3]). I don't think it is an exaggeration to say people are being slaughtered. Whatever you might think of them, these are human beings. Like you and I. Living, laughing, loving, beautiful people. Lives wasted. Mothers, brothers, children and babies. Fighting for their lives. Their right to exist. To breathe air. To share this planet of ours.

Where is the outrage? Where is the action? Where is the disgust? 

Shame on this government. 

Can you imagine if this was any other country in the world? If this was Ukraine. Russia doing this to Ukrainian people. Ukrainian women and children.

Secondly, and this is not worse, but it is terrifying and at least as shameful. The action we do see from this government, one of the few really strong and forceful actions that it has taken. Has been to stamp out, what many view as legitimate protest, by labelling the protest group Palestine Action a terrorist organisation. Proscribing them.

I am not going to comment on that group at all. I do not support them and these words should not be taken to indicate my support for a proscribed organisation in any way.

But I will say I am hugely disappointed in this move by the UK government. Shocked that a Labour government could do it. We are already seeing around the country the fall out and implications of this legislation. 

One instance of this, caught on camera, incensed me[^4]. A single 42 year old lady in Kent standing, protesting on a roundabout holding a palestinian flag and a sign that says stop the genocide in Gaza. She is approached and frankly intimidated by two armed policemen. And despite her vocally voicing that she does not support Palestine Action they threaten her with arrest if she does not desist and cite the legislation that this labour government passed as justification.

Was this the intent of passing this legislation? To scare middle aged ladies into silence of Gaza. On the plight of the Palestinian people?

Because let me tell you, I see it for what it is. Half of me is terrified. Half of me is still in disbelief. This is authoritarianism intimidation. Plain and simple. It does not belong in our country. This is bloody Britain. We do not stand for this kind of behaviour from our government. From Labour as well. I am appalled.

My parents, who I will include in this email, could have been that lady in Kent. Mid 60s, peacefully voicing their opinions and showing solidarity for Palestine. As they do most Saturdays in our small town of Ilkley.

Would you send armed police after them. Maybe you want their address so you can send the Gestapo round to round them up?

I mean really, Catherine, is this the kind of government you dreamed of being part of? Is this the kind of leadership you want to be associated with? Is this the best we can offer as an alternative to the Tories or Farages Reform.

Disgraceful. Where is the vision? Where is the belief that we can create a better future. A future we would be proud to call home. Proud to show our children.

Let me end with this: HISTORY WILL JUDGE YOU. SHAME ON LABOUR.

I do not think I will be able to vote for you again.

I look forward to your thoughtful, considered response to this defining issue of our era.

Many thanks,
