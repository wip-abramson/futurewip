Welcome, this blog is a playful experiment in which I intend to explore, craft and inhabit an alternative presentation of self in the digital realm. One focused on practicing and expanding imaginative capacity and creative practices as a superpower for navigating our complex social reality and the challenges of the coming century.

Currently this blog is a placeholder and a place to put things. A work in progress. A self that is still forming. 

My hope is that the identity that emerges will positively influence my actions in the present, creating new possibilities and opening up different perspectives. 

With that in mind, the words on this site are written for my future selves first. Although, you are also most welcome to them. I hope they bring you value in whatever form that takes for you.

Enjoy!
